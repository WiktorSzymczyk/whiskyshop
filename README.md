# Whisky Shop
This is an entire project that I have been working on over the course of last week. I have used HTML, CSS and JS.

* This is an example of that

What to do next?
1.  Make sure that all elements are responsive
2.  Sketch and Create 404 Page
3.  Create pages such as: All Products, Single Product, Payment Option, Posts Page, About Page and Contact Page
